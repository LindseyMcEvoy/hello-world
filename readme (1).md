# Prosper Loan Dataset Exploration
## by Lindsey McEvoy


## Dataset

For my exploration, I used the Prosper Loan dataset.  This dataset contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.  The dataset can be found here and a data dictionary explaining the variables in the dataset can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gDyi_L4UvIrLTEC6Wri5nbaMmkGmLQBk-Yx3z0XDEtI/edit#gid=0).
